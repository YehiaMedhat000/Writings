Hello, today feels a little bit different, I feel overwhelmed, since I need to do many things at the moment, I went for a walk today it wasn't the best place I'd ever go to, but it was much nicer to change scenes and see the outer world, I think I just need to have more regulations, aka a routine for my day which determines how should I be living my day-to-day life.

One of the things that really turned my thinking, that I have seen some gadgets that are related to maintenance of phones and that kind of electronic devices, the problem is that I'm more in programming and software-related things and applications, not to repair physical things, so I need to really rethink about it. I just asked for the price of them willing to buy now or even later, nevertheless that I'm just occupied with a lot of projects, and not in need to disturb myself with more ideas, I'm actually out of a routine for the normal day-to-day life, so now, I should be focusing on building habits and fixing myself mind and body, surely in the meanwhile I'll do so studies and projects, the idea is that I must not overwhelm myself, because it will depress me later and make feel I'm too far away from what I want to do.

I'm supposed to keep the habit of going for a walk daily, journaling, and reading Quraan, the last is the most important, I don't know what to type more, but I'm pretty sure I have to organize even the journaling I do, to really match what I need, it's good anyway to journal even in this unorgainzed way.
