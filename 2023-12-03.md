Well, I really use this word much, don't I?!!, but, this is not the point for now. I yesterday have done something which isn't acceptable from me at all, I don't know why I just change to be a worse figure.
This is really bad, but, today may I want to talk specifically about one thing, which is: Does Allah love me?

### Does Allah love me?
Well, what I see so far in my life makes feel like that Allah hates me, for instance, losing a lot of my characteristics as a good human (sanity, intelligence, passion, determination, etc).
I don't know, this even makes me confused here, because, are these things supposed to be a measure on which I can tell that Allah loves me or not??
Well, even if they're not, there are other things like: postponing the memorization of Quraan, forgetting a lot of it, not being able to pray with focus and, more obviously, having this kind of questions inside me.
So, would you believe that if Allah has just left with all the good things you wish to have while you're addicted to $YOUR_ADDICTION?? impossible isn't it?
It's just really natural to lose a lot of things to figure out, nevertheless that it's already really obvious that you have enormous problem in your life, that you need to change!
But, the problem is that you still don't change at all, well, is it because I can't change?, surely, that Allah doesn't prevent from changing to the better case, but, why I feel it's darn hard to do so?
Well, you'll have to feel this hardship while attempting the change, and you need to be patient enough to carry out the change.

### How should I change?
There are main things that I have to cut off or stop doing completely, but, the problem is, as it's obvious!, that I have tried already doing so, but, I failed for too many times.
Well, all my failures were about having some hard challenges or failures (feeling bad in other words), in the same time of feeling like I deserve it, or more specifically weakness.
So, I need to avoid those times or moments as much, how??
If I need to really discuss what I need to do to stop and change and get out from this addiction and be generally a better human, I need to bare in mind that nothing is gonna be the magical wand with which I'm gonna get out of the addiction that I had for about 10 years now!! in addition to that, they are bunch of things not to do them all, but when you're told about them, the therapist, who's mostly just a youtube video, tells his audience all the possible effective solutions to do the therapy for them selves on their own, so, don't feel bad when you don't do everything they talk about.
Also, no need to fall when you fail. I'm really unorganized here, but, the next one; is that I'm sure that I need to change my mind set about many things: religion, myself, others, others' sins, others' failures, others gifts, or more breifly comparison with other people.
