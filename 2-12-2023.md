Well, It seems like a really stupid idea to journal here, but, so far it's better than normal paper and faster and more versatile.
Surely, when you have autosuggestion features and you're just able to erase something instead of wigling a line over it.

Well, I'm supposed to be talking about the things that mostly irritate me from time to time. Ok, this seems simple, but, hope it's gonna be helpful any how!!

The first irritation (from my point of view) is being disrespected, by myself basically, and avoided or rejected from others because of constantly saying silly jokes.

I always say somethings like: I don't deserve to live, I shouldn't have been born, I don't deserve the food, the place where I live, the education and resources I have access to, I don't deserve anything.
I think this is mostly because of **PORN** and **MASTURBATION**. I have lost a lot, if not all, of my confidence after series of things that have happened to me over the years, additional to my addiction.

For instance, failing to be in the department of Computer science in the faculty, and this one specially seems to have a composite effect on me, I think because of that it wasn't my decision to join the faculty of engineering from the beginning I was, or I just convince my self that I was, convinced to join the faculty due to the probability of getting to the department safely, nevertheless, it was probable by 2% only!!

Not having the ability to keep up with the faculty, like I don't really study the same spirit I had just before one term!! which is amazing how I was changed vastly through couple of months, this is drastically bad!!

Seeing all the others living just fine with true smiles, or as I claim that they are, nevertheless, that some of them are not up to things I could do or I even do, this is not arrogance from me, but really who of them knows about python as much, manim, numpy, c, pointers, bash, etc.

I see others happy go to travel and they overall get higher grades than me, nevertheless, that, I pray, they don't, some of them are girls with incovenient veils, and may other bad things, but and surprisingly, they're just take it easy and are much more calm than me dealing with everything in the faculty.

They are more organized, more intelligent, more ready than me all the time. So, I find myself losing all the time

May because of my sins and bad behaviours I just see myself not deserving any gifts from god in anything, studying, being calm, being respectful, being steady, being sharp and focused, nothing.

I don't know that was much, but really wondering about if I will have to read all this again so I don't remention ideas here, as I should be focusing on finding solutions to the problems I have.
That's it for today it's about 9 o'clock and I have to leave to the gym.
