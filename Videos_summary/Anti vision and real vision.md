## Note
**I'm sure I'll add more to this, as I'll be already reading it daily just not to forget why I have to stop doing that thing, because I can't be continuing like this, I just cannot imagine how bad somebody's life can be with just doing that, my anti-vision was so unclear yet it made me really sorrowful thinking that that life may be my own one day, and already some aspects are being applied to me and the way I live**
## My vision
Or the version of myself that I'm looking forward to being:
Well since it's a little bit hard to talk about it, let's talk about my daily routine as my best self, then talk about the things I really would like at least to try or to study, since I don't have a really rigid about what I want to achieve yet, but at least there are somethings I wanna stop and things I wanna make in my daily routine.

I see myself, as the best version of me, to be awake before Al-fajr prayer by about 30 minutes to hour, and surely sleeping early enough to be able to do this, and the first thing to go to do Wuduu', and pray for a half hour, then do ask Allah to ease me whatever I need or want to do or achieve, then head to the fair prayer, be an Imam praying in the front, not because I wanna be in that place for showing off, it's just the fact that I was there, and I'm supposed to be there, then stay in the Mosque to say the prayers of morning, and read Quran whenever I have the chance to do so, walking, transportations, or just having nothing available else yet better to do than reading it.

Afterwards, if not fasting, go to eat the breakfast which should leave me hungry still, and after that I finished reading some Quran, let's say I have no place, no job that makes get out of home for that day, I do some exercises at home, then go to study, or work on some project, or even for a walk on the beach if not in mood, I shouldn't specify many things here, because as a routine, it should be robust to take any kind of activities I would do in my entire life, and surely at that point of life I'd have exited porn and masturbation, It's out of context, but I feel like sincerely crying since long, well after that may go to do some shopping for mom, or for myself, if living alone, or whatever, may be taking a 1-hour nap until the next prayer.

After that just getting back to study and working on projects, and just continuing like that until I sleep at about 10 pm, and the cycle turns.

In general, just stopping that addiction will surely unleash a variety of things that I should have done since too long, it feels like I'm in the mid of the ocean with no foreseeable land to go to, completely helpless.

## My anti-vision

It's surely worse or much worse than what I'm now, nevertheless, I feel that I'm living already my worst days, but let's fancy how it may look like yet realistically.

Skipping Al-fajr prayer and sleeping until after Al-dhuhur prayer, and in need to get a shower, since masturbated heavily the last night, or may even worse, which is having sex with a paid bi***, forgetting almost completely the Quran that I memorized and revised over the years, eating heavily whenever possible, but just guess what I may don't have the money nor the ability of any kind to get some food, spending my time on reels and short videos and skipping studying, and just getting more fats because of how much I eat whenever I have the opportunity.

Then continuing like that until I sleep, maybe before Al-fajr prayer, always Having the worst vulgar words attending my tongue, and the most of them forwarded to me, and doing the same the next day.

With parents losing hope of me getting successful and being old enough to be in need of help, but still fighting to get me enough food because I always finish it all, and in running out of energy as get older, but I'm just the same lazy useless person.

And finishing their trying to keep a life with food and shelter, with having 0 emotions to their death, and laying the blame on them claiming that they haven't raised me well, and continuing like this until my end comes, may at that point I'd have forgotten to pray or even how to do, chatting with whores and trying to masturbate as much as I can, with the angels of death coming angrily and furiously to take my soul, with all the pain that I already had and the regret that I had, but just trying to forget it using porn and that kind of stuff, but it's no longer available and I'm already seeing all those stacking bad things I have done in my life are coming in front of my eyes when my soul is being torn out of me.

Being helpless at that surrounded with junk, and nobody to help me, or just feel sorry for me dying, and dying alone, with the police a week later breaking in to take my corpse as it has being making an unbearable smell, burying me with nobody of them actually know me, as no one of whom I know of my family nor my friends, because I'd have lost them all at that point and they wouldn't like to see me again.

Ending the no-funeral burying, I stay their alone for hundreds, may be thousands or years seeing the consequence of my day-to-day careless life every single moment and living the worst time someone could ever live, because I've been just laying blame over the others because of how bad my life was, instead of changing myself.
