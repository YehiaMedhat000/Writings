Hello, well, I have just woken up and prayed the Fajr Prayer, such a good feeling, because I haven't done so since many days we could say many weeks, I haven't even counted, that's awful, the main idea that made me feel that's worth writing down some ideas is that I take care of people's looks and thoughts about things that I just did imperfectly. I don't know, but the instance that flashed in my mind was when I get to the respond the salutaion to someone, it would sound a bit awkward, so I think about peoples' minds, what do they think about?, do they think about my response? I felt stupid at that moment, so, they surely look at me from that prespective, may I should have said it in a better way, etc etc, that's really crazy, I think that's because I judge people too much, same thing, when I salute someone and he donesn't repond, I get to think like following: look at that awkward human, why didn't he respond me? does he hate me somehow? didn't he listen to me? and many of these ideas which surely will affect the space I have in my mind for things much smaller and important like studying, or just to be in a steady state, not in fight and judging state, it feels crazy. I honestly don't know what would be the solution for this, but let me just occupy my mind with whatever thing when I get to those points, because I don't wanna stop salutations, because this is bad, and will actually sound more awkward. May it's the fact that I'm not delicate enough with my own self, that's why I feel too tough when thinking about others, nevertheless they may have their reason, or whatever why do I even give that much care for so tiny things, especially that giving that care doesn't change things to the better! that's absolutely crazy, I think need to tolerate myself more, I mean in things which I should be tolerant, what are those things in which I should tolerate myself for more? I think being tolerant in all things, so what about being careless? I don't mean to be careless, but just not to care too much for those things, I mean to exactly be normal, but what does it mean specifically? not to get mad? I already don't get mad for those missing or awkward salutations, so that one doesn't sound like the right one. I got more sure now that the simplest solution for it, is just to occupy my mind with something that keeps me calm and uncapable of thinking too much of those things, because I have a high level of anxiety and recently only I got to discover this, that's why I'm being addicted to PORN and MASTURBATION! that's why I'm having a grumpy stomach all the time, that's why I used to eat much, or just eat before beginning or recontinuing tasks, I eat also when I get to failure point. So, basically I think it's about reading Quraan while walking, and trying in the first days of recovery to forcefully shutdown those ideas and not to distract the Quraan that I should be reading in those moments, or in general to worship verbally, which is called Thikr.

That was a lot, but I'm sure there's just more as much already, but I think this is good for now, holding ideas in mind is awful, hehehehe, isn't it? I really wish that this will help, now I'm supposed to get ready for going for walk.

Got back here again, that wasn't so long until I got back, it's just the fact that I need to get rid of the mental jam that happens to me very often, and now it comes to me the idea about my family, specifically my parents, their relationship has been and was for long time not very stable, I felt many times like I wanna escape to live alone forever than continuoing to live with them, because of how much toxic the home, which is supposed to be the place in which you feel safe, was in many times, well the deficiency in the relationship between mom and dad, maybe due to some reasons I know but I wouldn't like to type even here, but the deficiency between me and dad and me and mom, is due to the fact that they see my life through their glasses they want me to put on their clothes and walk their ways, and do their dreams, which is really explained, may I say that they just want me to be the best, but, from their point of view, I don't know, my life now is already shattered into pieces, I'm just happy that there's something that could stop me from going worse in my life which is ironically the same family that I'm talking about the deficiency in my relationship with them, really sarcastic isn't it?

It's just the case that nobody likes to live in such a flammable atmosphere, many fights have been arising between mom and dad, I don't know, I see those fights aren't necessary and arise due to non-important reasons, I need to type about many things here, just the fact that I just remembered about the so-called duty to get yourself married to some girl, actually away from the affections and difficulties of the life we live, it's actually supposed to be common sense to get yourself married as soon as possible because we need it, we all need it, both girls and boys, surely boys do need that much more, but we still both need it and the lack of it is corrupting the world, not just the countries we live in, the world is crazy bro :'), but, when getting to mind the decision of the marriage in such, in such circumstances, it's too hard to do, isn't it??!!!, may we say it's almost impossible, since the price of only acquiring an apartment is high enough to pay it in years of hard-working in a well-paid job, if you find it, in addition to the so-called minor things, like the furniture, appliances, and other needs of the life, so, honestly I feel like I wanna do it and get to save money from now, but, really!!!, why don't I just live a normal life, or as we call it, and later things come, well, we all know already why this is bad, you're addicted, aren't you?, you were trying to call bitches and whores to get to have sex with them, weren't you? so you're the first one to know why such thing is so important for all males in that kind of situations, and by the way, the majority of people, married and unmarried, are addicted to porn and masturbate on regular basis, which is insane, it's really obvious why the world do this, but why the people make it so damn hard to marrie their daughters? that's a mystery, or just a fool maybe, or it's a fool already, but the satisfactory answer at the end is to rip off that kind of ideas and ambitions of your mind for these years, because as you see it's unapplicable, ok!!

May I get to talk about one more thing, like, I don't know, I really feel good when I get to do some task that matches my level of proficiency, like what I've done yesterday of making my little brother a 1000-question set of multiplication problem of the properties I want. I did that already previously, but for now, I wish I'm not journaling to escape things I have to do, or to be honest, that's a much better way of escaping stress and anxiety and all kinds of bad feelings.

I think this is the last time I journal on this day, so let me finish by saying that I need to revise what I want to do and what I want to be, I don't know it's hard to determine now especially when you're amazed by many things, I think I'll find it out when I try many things, but this way is the same thing from which I'm escaping, but why? I think it's because it makes me overloaded with tasks and things that I kind of have to do, since they are my dreams and things I really want to accomplish, by the way, most of them are just related to programming, but what about being focused?? like for real, what on earth do I do when I apply to a SolidWorks and cad design courses that are a bit far from the programming discipline, is it because of the idea that I have taken for granted so far, that you'll regret what you haven't tried more than what have tried, but this is quite untrue, I feel it now, not just believe it :'(, since I already had some non-complete yet good track that I was going through and nevertheless that I'm really impressed by many other fields, but this is distracting, not helping at all, at least may you'll need to learn some skill or some software, but rationally and logically enough that will happen when you need it, not for joy!! I think that may this happened also due to the fact that I tried hard to convince myself that I don't hate any discipline trying to pass the fact that I lost the opportunity which later was confirmed to be the only one to get to formal education about computer engineering, I really hate that, but may that's why, or may because I had no idea, about what will I see in the region I was forcefully put into, and was just trying to keep up with them, I also in the meanwhile of the first term tried to forget the faculty and studying hard for it, since I saw in that time that it already took a lot of effort but didn't give me what I wanted, how simple my problems are, and how trifle my ideas are, and how caiotich my mind is.

Well to be honest I really remember in each time I get to making some decision, I obviously see what is the right thing to do, and there and only there comes the opportunity to make your life better or just worse, you know in yourself, or no, you don't know, or I just don't know, I really don't know, wow, that's a lot of negations :'), amm, I just remembered the fact that may objecting my family until I get to the faculty of my choice from the beginning would have gotten me some quieter life or not, but I think so, may I just need to stop saying what if I had done that not that, something would have been better, that's not appropriate, aka shitty.

That's surprising how many ideas I had to write about, this should be enough for today, I wish to get to translating these in italian some day, so I enhance my level and increase my vocab in italian.
