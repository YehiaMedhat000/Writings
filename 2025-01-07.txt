Hello, today I'd like to type only in italian, but I feel more free when using English, may later I'll use some ai bot to translate and help me expand my Italian and hone my skills in that language. Anyway, I needed to write down somethings I felt and I thought of, I mostly forgot most of them now, unofortunately that I forgot many ideas from which I had in mind, but what I really remember that they are connected to my sadness and disappointment, that low level of soul, feeling a dead-like person.

The main idea that I got to, that whenever I try to get better at anything, I just compare myself to whomever I find better than me, and just deal myself like an absolute stupid helpless human because I don't get to that level of skill in whatever. This surely will set me down and will make me feeling even worse, won't it. And lastly it made tend to feel like it's no use, or actually it always did make me feel like that, so, whenever trying to get better, I get disappointed easily like that and collapse.

There the idea shines of having continuous progress and potential fall-backs all the time, you have to accept your human nature especially that you're trying to exit many bad things at once, or at least one at a time and gaining good habits and building them, that's not easy anyway, is it? so you have to stick a little more rigidly to your plans of gettings better and try to first never compare yourself with others, neither in cases you're the better one, nor in cases you're the worse.

That's not the end, since I found out that I need a permanent outlet for those ideas that crush my head and mind leaving unable to continuoue as I should do.
