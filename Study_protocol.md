# Study Protocol

#### *Why Writing this?*
In the 3rd term in the faculty (FOE), I had a lot of difficulties to study and also, a lot of inconsistencies and misconceptions about the ways I have already tried, and really unchallengeable facts about studying.
Which made me at the end of the term having a lot of gaps in my studies and a lot of disappointment in consequence.

#### *What does this aim to?*
To predefine most if not all of the behaviours towards how and why I should do something and not the other when studying.

## *Attending lectures*

## *Writing notes (generally)*

#### In lectures (NEEDS UPDATE)
I actually really believe that this is something I should rethink about later, but for now, let's write down everything I feel genuine

#### Online lecturers, books, etc.
* Things you firstly know (Firstly)
* Things that feels important (Important)
* Things haven't been understood well (Ambiguous)

## *Summaries*

#### Mind maps
* If most of the ideas in the material given are connected somehow

#### Flash Cards
* Pieces of information that could fit alone as a question
* Some repetitive and highly important notes

#### Comprehensiveness

## *Seeking help*

#### Questions
* Solving problems: keep your solution neat enough to be reviewable.
* Why something not the other.
    * And this also comes when solving problems.
    * Trying to new ways to solve the problems.
