# Study Protocol

### Why Writing this?
_______________________
In the 3rd term in the faculty (FOE), I had a lot of difficulties to study and also, a lot of inconsistencies and misconceptions about the ways I have already tried, and really unchallengeable facts about studying.
Which made me at the end of the term having a lot of gaps in my studies and a lot of disappointment in consequence.

### What does this aim to?
____________________________
To predefine most if not all of the behaviours towards how and why I should do something and not the other when studying.

### Higher order learning
    It's a way in which you don't only understand and remember effectively pieces of information, but, you also relate them to each other. it's made of stages:
    1. Lower learning level
        1. Remember
        2. Understand
    2. Higher order level
        1. Apply
        2. Analyze, evaluate, create

        You need to ask some question about concepts, and they're:
        * Why is this concept important
        * How does it relate to other info
        * How will I use this info (in solving problems for instance)
