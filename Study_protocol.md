# Study Protocol

### *Why Writing this?*
_______________________
In the 3rd term in the faculty (FOE), I had a lot of difficulties to study and also, a lot of inconsistencies and misconceptions about the ways I have already tried, and really unchallengeable facts about studying.
Which made me at the end of the term having a lot of gaps in my studies and a lot of disappointment in consequence.

### *What does this aim to?*
____________________________
To predefine most if not all of the behaviours towards how and why I should do something and not the other when studying.
