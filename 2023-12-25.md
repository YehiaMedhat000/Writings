## Questions and admittions I have

### Admittions
***

* Actually, I care for how people look at me, at least recently
* I care mainly for how girls look at me, and how they look, feel, laugh, smile or breifly everygthing they do and even don't do!!
This has to be strongly relative to the addiction I have, 10 years agoðŸ˜…
* I'm sure that seeing others happy while I'm not is one of my subproblems.
* I think that every girl who just told me anything, which could even be "Can you leave us some space on the bench??", could be my wife and I really imagine them to be!!
* I'm sure that all of the above is strongly related to the addiction I have
* I feel lonely, may be all the time, and this is because I have lost hope of sharing issues with my family forever, because, they may tell somethings that tease and irritate me, nevertheless, they don't mean to irritate.
But, as they already don't know much about me, or as I claim, they don't know that those things really make me annoyed
* I feel like I'm holding the failure of my dad's choice for me, nevertheless and as this idea isn't effective at all, I just ignore it and try to go ahead, but, **finding my self always failing** to keep up with my expectations made me feel even worse, and uncomfortable with the idea of completing with the same amount of efforts I used to making and exerting.

### Questions
***
* Am I holding the consequences of dad's choice for me?
Well, there a lot of things that come to my mind when I think about this, that I can't even think clearly, but, I can say, somehow, that _**no**_, it's not about my dad, because of the following:

1. I have accepted the risk, nevertheless, I knew it's risky, but, overall I have listened and was convinced that FOE was the best solution for me as someone who lives in Alexandria

2. I already love learning and I don't have any problems with studying anyother subjects than the ones I would take in the computer science department, I really love knowledge, but my **problem was** that I can't really solidify this knowledge because of chaos and having my focus divided into many things (alx, resala charity, studying for the faculty). I think that was the hardest part for me, I'm not accustomed to doing things loosely, I love learning but only if it's firm and I can explain and simplify to myself before others.

3. Thinking about subreasons for the failures I was having instead of being clear and focused on studying harder and figuring out the issues and fixing them.

* How many failures I have failed in my life?
* In other words, Is it considered to be failure to not be able to work during my studies?
* Or not being able to marry or even tell her about my intention?
* Or not succeeding in entering the department I had my dreams built upon it?
* Or not having the ability, as I claim, to complete my studies normally in the current department?
* Or not even being able to stop my addiction to *\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\**?
* Or more breifly am I able to meet my expectations? or do I even have to?

For the first one, about working, I feel like it mostly comes from the idea that I have ruined things in the home, well, it was only the door and the fridge, and they were not intentionally done surely, but, being unable to pay for my mistakes, was somehow fatal for my feeling **especially when listening from my dad some blaming about the costs of living** that they are already high!!
In addition to, but I think that this point really comes from the previous one, that I want to feel dependent I don't want to ask my dad about money, even for clothing! and I feel really shamed for doing so.
In addition to seeing pour people and being unable to help them, because and as it's really counterintuitive, I can't help myself already.
Well, I was about to forget the expenses that my dad had to pay for the surgery I had in my face because of the fight I had with my older brother, in addition to the very expensive medicine he bought for me, and all that seemed to happen out of nothing!!

For the second one, If I couldn't apply for a job, or I wasn't let to somehow, because of many things, including to the refusal from my father, so, I can't pay for the simplest expenses of marriage!!
For being unable to tell her about, don't be fool dude! why would you even tell her without having anything to introduce as the key for accepting you!! so, it was completely for saying nothing about it, you know girls, and specially that pure kind of girls are somehow highly affected by being told such things. so, that was completely wise and correct not to tell.

For the third one, I have studied well for the exams and from the grades I didn't seem to have a big problem, but, It was very clear that I didn't care for the hard subjects mainly, chemistry and mechanics, and mechanics had more ignorance from my side, The problem with chemistry seemed to be lack of resources or just using the wrong resources, they were accurate and good, but misinterpreted and more difficult to deal with. and then in the exams I felt like every thing was going fine, but later on seeing the results I was shocked! just tried to convince myself that it's gonna be fine and there's gonna be a big potential for being able to join the department, or atleast I may just be dropped to the next one (communications department).

For the fourth one, I have misorganized things and felt like it will go fine without the need or effort to bother about how it should be organized and processed, and as I'm not accustomed by the way to giving bad results and not taking care of studying I was degrading with disappointments and fear of completeing like this.
In addition to being divided into many things which later were relieved to be two things only, but, very lately have I recognized that's still impossible to keep going in everything! atleast without system.
I haven't succeeded or achieved what I was waiting for from the alx program, nor the faculty, this was enough to making feel ruined and useless most of the time if not all of it.

For the fourth one, Being until now addicted to the so called \*\*\*\* is a big problem and I'm really really sure that I stop may all of the problems wouldn't have even existed, because, I normally as any other human get disappointed and sad, but the problem with the automatic strategy which I use with my disappointments, which is watching \*\*\*\* and \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, I have tried going to the gym to make me out of power and ideas to doing that thing, but, I find myself having the same traits or even worse, **yes I have big problem in my expectations about, well, everything**, I have to consider multiple solutions not only one or two, especially that the problem has been life long with me. (about 10 years or more)

To sum up the last question: I haven't failed to work, to marry, may to abandon \*\*\*\* and \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, and not to join that department I just need to stop comparing myself with the people with envy and greed, in addition to regularizing my expectations about myself and others.

I'm still really chaiotic in my thinking and even asking my questions, I should be more organized in this

There will come to me again thoughts like, you're better than them why do they get higher than you? you should be in their place not vice versa, you should be able to do the alx program or you will lose the time you spend in it and lose your goal to be a SE, why are they happy and I'm not? do Allah love them more than me? why I feel unorganized? Can't I study any more? This was dad's mistake to force into here, he should have left me to choose, I should have listened to myself, I don't have friends, I'm poor. Do they achieve better than me even with the fun they have and wasted their time doing? Am I really dumb like that that I can't even keep up with them? And so on, so don't be dramatic, I have no idea about how to deal with the continuous flow of this kind of ideas to me, but, I will try my best and focus on my really high expectations and being realistically orgnaized and doing not saying and mostly out of sexual imaginations or \*\*\*\* in general.


So, my main three problems, big expectations, self-to-others comparisons, addiction.
