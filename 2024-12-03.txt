Here we are back to writing or, more accurately, typing my dairies, which I find to be hard to stick to, nevertheless it's so easy to miss, especially with things that makes it easier and easier for me to do so, may I'm here to avoid going for a walk that I don't think will make better, or just to try hopefully to get rid of any of the henious feelings I have so far, I feel that chest pain continuing to get to me, with an unidentified reason for feeling a heavy wheight on my chest.

I always still say that I wish to die, I don't know, this is supposed to be a very bad thing, as the doctor used it for diagnosing my case with depression, so I should not be doing the same, but this is what I feel, or may what I convince myself to feel, I need to get rid of one thing in my life which will make it, undoubtedly, better. I was playing for a week or just unseriously living, trying to pass the time without any kind of real work, or real tasks being done, or any tasks at all.

I really feel better when I deal with computers or do something that just approaches me to programming something or writing some code or dealing with some terminal, I felt better and engaged just with trying to install void linux, which was hard by the way, but I felt engaged and doing some kind of progress and appreciated work, at least, from my own self, which shows really obviously how would my life be better just choosing the right thing from the beginning and not letting others fuck my life.

There's still a lot to say, or may it's just the case that I have nothing to say but the things that I already have said, and done in the past, may I need to feel proud of myself, and to appreciate myself, but this will not come without tendency to get better with touchable and seeable progress in the real world, like, going to the gym, stacking the habits, the good ones, like, reading the quraan daily, studying, doing my projects, especially the ones that are already begun but not finished yet, and that's how I feel I will get better, and surely stop the one thing that makes me always feel bitter, sorrowful and hard feelings, which is masturbation and porn, I feel aroused now, which is really sarcastic in the same time, that I say that I should stop this thing and take off those clothings of infinite sadness, I used to be a man of work, a person of doing things that he's proud of, I didn't use to be a boy who wastes his time and life for nothing or almost nothing.

I don't know what should be written in such kind of documents and dairies, but I really don't feel well, I feel like getting friends, ones who make me feel that I'm precious, that I'm appreciated, those feelings that I feel that I miss the most, may because I used to being seen as the undefeated man and always on progress? I don't know, but that looks like to be really the case, because just think of it, why I need appreciation from others? well, but in the same time just making the things that I have to do makes feel better, so, it doesn't really look like that I need outer feel of appreciation, rather than inner feeling of appreciation, and why don't I get it? because I have been losing control of my acts, for instance. I have been degrading and feeling more disappointed regarding myself, and my performance in many things, which I always can connect to the one thing that I must stop, PORN.

Still don't know what exactly to say, but I find out that I still have more ideas to come up with, any way, that's enough for now, may I will go for a walk, may it's gonna make me feel better.
