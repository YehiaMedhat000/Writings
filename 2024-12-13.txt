Hello, it's just awkward to write your dairies at the beginning of the day, which is supposed to be a summary for the day, but, I feel like trying this here, I'm in the Antondiados gardens, it's really big, it's the first time to see a real garden, this should make me think about the fact that when we get to the heaven, how will we feel, it's amazing, to be in such big quiet place.

Once again for the normal saying of being in need of change and that I have to change, etc, and saying also that this time is gonna be different, I really wish that's gonna be the final time I do this, I wish I see myself like never before, the real human inside me, how is he gonna look like if he's having some projects to do, some lectures to study or kind of hard work that he's in need to do, instead of being stressed and anxious of almost nothing.

Well, it's noteworthy that one of the most things that could take me out of the loop of watching videoes or trying to install some dating apps to try out, is and will be always programming or dealing with a cli, which is insane, and sorrowful in the same fucking time, I just need to forget about the fact that I'm not in computer science or software engineering department, and just remember the fact Dr. Al-Habrook is a great programming mind, who has even rejected to get to the computer science department, it's just needed to so, because you're already dipped in it, and it's your destiny now, so embrace it instead of being hindered by it, nevertheless that it's already having the advantage to making you better, just remember how much would you like to be someone like that professor that day.

It just needs your focus and stamina to continue learning hard things and doing hard work everyday without stopping ever, how could this happen?? just stop masturbating and dreaming of sex every now and then, and your life will be undoubtedly a better life, so far I have said almost everything, I should be going anyway.
