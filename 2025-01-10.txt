That's too early to begin to journal, but I have lost and masturbated yesterday without resistance even, which is kinda "wtf", I should have at least resisted, now my day is ruined from its beginning, well, let me be a little more clear, I just need to follow my religion as much as I can, and my life will automatically get better. why on earth this is true, just look at most people who do, their lives mightn't be the best, from the financial or other aspects, but their lives are quite organized and quiet, which is exactly what I want nowadays, well, here come to me some ideas I want to write down about here, like the fact that, actually, I'm so trivial, may I say I'm the most trivial human who I've seen in the world, yes my life won't get better immediately with the same level of religion I was doing, obviously I need more, and it doesn't have to get better in all aspects, breifly this world isn't perfect, so, just don't assume that you'll have the 100% stage, I need to do read quraan now, and do other stuff later, like hindering my eyes from looking whereever, but, when I fail at some point, I don't have to blame myself in a childy manner, I mean it's normal we all fail at some point, just accept and work on not getting back to failures.

I don't know, nevertheless, there are a lot of associated ideas about this, but it seems like I have forgotten how normal life looks like, how normal human get happy, well, I'm depressed anyway.

I don't know, it feels like I wish dying.
